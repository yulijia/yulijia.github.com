# Scalar Data

(Larning Perl: Chapter 2)
---

### * Numbers

- Floating-Point Literals
```perl
1.25
255.00
7.25e45 # 7.25 times 10 to the 45th power (a big number)
-12.E-23 # another way to say that - the E may be uppercase
```
- Integer Literals
```perl
0
-40
3249089384 # also can write as 3_249_089_384  
```
- Nondecimal Integer Literals
```perl
0377 # 377 octal, same as 255 decimal
0xff # FF hex, also 255 decimal
0b11111111 # also 255 decimal 
```
- Numeric Operators
```perl
# + plus, - minus, * times, / divided
10.2 / 0.3 # 10.2 divided by 0.3, or 34
10 / 3 # always floating-point divide, so 3.3333333...
```
---

### * Strings

- Single-Quoted String Literals
```perl
'fred' # those four characters: f, r, e, and d
'' # the null string (no characters)
'hello\n' # hello followed by backslash followed by n
```
.red[Note that the \n within a single-quoted string is not interpreted as a newline, but as the
two characters backslash and n. ]

- Double-Quoted String Literals
```perl
"hello world\n" # hello world, and a newline
"coke\tsprite" # cook, a tab, and sprite
```

---

- String Operators 

String values can be concatenated with the . operator. (Yes, that’s a single period.)

```perl
"hello" . "world" # same as "helloworld"
"hellow" . '' . "world" # same as 'hello world'
'hello world' . "\n" # same as "hello world\n"
```
A special string operator is the string repetition operator, consisting of the single
lowercase letter x. This operator takes its left operand (a string) and makes as many
concatenated copies of that string as indicated by its right operand (a number).

```perl
fred" x 3        # is "fredfredfred"
"barney" x (4+1) # is "barney" × 5, or "barneybarneybarneybarneybarney"
5 × 4            # is really "5" × 4, which is "5555"
```
---

### * Perl’s Built-in Warnings

Perl can be told to warn you when it sees something suspicious going on in your pro-
gram. To run your program with warnings turned on, use the -w option on the com-
mand line:

<code>$ perl -w my_program</code>

Or, if you always want warnings, you may request them on the #! line:

<code>#!/usr/bin/perl -w</code>

---

### * Scalar Variables

A *variable* is a name for a container that holds one or more values. 
A scalar variable holds a single scalar value.

Scalar variable names begin with a dollar sign followed by what we’ll call a Perl identifier: 
a letter or underscore, and then possibly more letters, or digits, or underscores. 
Another way to think of it is that it’s made up of alphanumerics and underscores, 
but can’t start with a digit. Upper- and lowercase letters are distinct: 
the variable <code>$Fred</code> is a different variable from <code>$fred</code>.

---

- Scalar Assignment

```perl
$fred = 17; # give $fred the value of 17
$barney = 'hello'; # give $barney the five-character string 'hello'
$barney = $fred + 3; # give $barney the current value of $fred plus 3 (20)
$barney = $barney * 2; # $barney is now $varney multiplied by 2 (40)
```
- Binary Assignment Operators

Expressions like $fred = $fred + 5 (where the same variable appears on both sides of
an assignment) occur frequently enough that Perl (like C and Java) has a shorthand for
the operation of altering a variable—the **binary assignment operator**. 

```perl
$fred = $fred + 5; # without the binary assignment operator
$fred += 5; # with the binary assignment operator
```
- Output with print

The <code>print</code> operator takes a scalar argument and puts it out without any embellishment onto standard
output.

```perl
print "hello world\n"; # say hello world, followed by a newline
```

---

- Interpolation of Scalar Variables into Strings

This means that any scalar variable† name in the
string is replaced with its current value.
```perl
$meal = "brontosaurus steak";
$barney = "fred ate a $meal"; # $barney is now "fred ate a brontosaurus steak"
$barney = 'fred ate a ' . $meal; # another way to write that
```

# Lists and Arrays

(Larning Perl: Chapter 3)

---

---

template: inverse

# Subroutines

(Larning Perl: Chapter 4)

---

### * Defining a Subroutine

To define your own subroutine, use the keyword <code>sub</code>, the name of the subroutine
(without the ampersand), then the indented block of code (in curly braces), which
makes up the body of the subroutine, 

```perl
sub marine {
  $n += 1; # Global variable $n
  print "Hello, sailor number $n!\n";
}
```
### * Invoking a Subroutine

```perl
&marine; # or just marine;
```

---

### * Return Values

As Perl is chugging along in a subroutine, it is calculating values as part of its series of actions. 
Whatever calculation is last performed in a subroutine is automatically also the return value.

```perl
sub sum_of_fred_and_barney {
  print "Hey, you called the sum_of_fred_and_barney subroutine!\n";
  $fred + $barney; # That's the return value
}

# This subroutine returns the larger value of $fred or $barney
sub larger_of_fred_or_barney {
  if ($fred > $barney) {
    $fred;
  } else {
    $barney;
  }
}

```

---

### * Arguments

Perl has subroutine arguments. To pass an argument list to the subroutine,
simply place the list expression, in parentheses, after the subroutine invocation.

```perl
$n = &max(10,15); # This sub call has two parameters

sub max {
  # Compare this to &larger_of_fred_or_barney
  if ($_[0] > $_[1]) {
    $_[0];
  } else {
    $_[1];
  }
}

$n = &max(10, 15, 27); # Oops! can not compare
```

---

### * Private Variables in Subroutines

By default, all variables in Perl are global variables; that is, 
they are accessible from every part of the program. 
But you can create private variables called lexical variables
at any time with the <code>my</code> operator:

```perl
sub max {
  my($m, $n); # new, private variables for this block
  ($m, $n) = @_; # give names to the parameters
  if ($m > $n) { $m } else { $n }
} # These variables are private (or scoped) to the enclosing block; 
# any other $m or $n is totally unaffected by these two. 

my($m, $n) = @_; # Name the subroutine parameters
```

---

### * Notes on Lexical (my) Variables
.left-column[
### The .red[my] operator doesn’t change the context of an assignment
]

.right-column[

```perl
my($num) = @_; # list context, same as ($num) = @_;
my $num = @_; # scalar context, same as $num = @_;
```
In the first one, $num gets the first parameter, as a list-context assignment; in the second,
it gets the number of parameters, in a scalar context. 
]

---

### * Notes on Lexical (my) Variables
.left-column[
### The .red[my] operator doesn’t change the context of an assignment
### Without the parentheses, .red[my] only declares a single lexical variable
]

.right-column[

```perl
my $fred, $barney; # WRONG! Fails to declare $barney
my($fred, $barney); # declares both
```
]

---

### * The use strict Pragma

Perl tends to be a pretty permissive language.* But maybe you want Perl to impose a
little discipline; that can be arranged with the <code>use strict</code> pragma.

A pragma is a hint to a compiler, telling it something about the code. In this case, 
the <code>use strict</code> pragma tells Perl’s internal compiler that 
it should enforce some good programming rules for the rest of this block or source file.

Most people recommend that programs that are longer than a screenful of text generally
need <code>use strict</code>. 

### * The return Operator

The <code>return</code> operator immediately returns a value from a subroutine

---

### * Persistent, Private Variables

Declaring our variable with state tells Perl to retain the variable’s value between calls
to the subroutine and to make the variable private to the subroutine

```perl
use 5.010;
sub marine {
  state $n = 0; # private, persistent variable $n
  $n += 1;
  print "Hello, sailor number $n!\n";
}
```
---

### Subroutines example

A Better &max Routine

```perl
$maximum = &max(3, 5, 10, 4, 6);
sub max {
  my($max_so_far) = shift @_;
  foreach (@_) {
    if ($_ > $max_so_far) {
      $max_so_far = $_;
    }
  }
  $max_so_far;
}
```

# Input and Output

(Larning Perl: Chapter 5)
---

### * Input from Standard Input

```perl
while (defined($_ = <STDIN>)) {
print "I saw $_";
}

```

we’re reading the input into a variable, checking that it’s **defined**, 
and if it is (meaning that we haven’t reached the end of the input) we’re running the body of the while loop. 

### * Output to Standard Output

```perl
print @array;  # print a list of items
print "@array";  # print a string (containing an interpolated array)
```
if @array holds <code>qw/ fred barney betty /</code>,
the first one prints <code>fredbarneybetty</code>, 
while the second prints <code>fred barney betty</code> separated by spaces.

---
Useful script

```perl
print <>; # source code for 'cat'
print sort <>; # source code for 'sort'
```
.red[\*] Perl makes it very easy for you to read input, 
from either the keyboard or a file, 
with the .red[Diamond Operator] <code><></code> . 
Each call to this operator will return one line from the current input source, 
which can be stored in a variable for later use. 

---

### * Formatted Output with printf

```perl
printf "%g %g %g\n", 5/2, 51/17, 51 ** 17;  #2.5 3 1.0683e+29

printf "in %d days!\n", 17.85;  #in 17 days!

printf "%6d\n", 42;  #output like ~~~~42 (the ~ symbol stands for a space)

printf "%10s\n", "wilma";  #looks like ~~~~~wilma

printf "%-15s\n", "flintstone";  #looks like flintstone~~~~~

printf "%12f\n", 6 * 7 + 2/3;  #looks like ~~~42.666667

printf "%12.3f\n", 6 * 7 + 2/3;  #looks like ~~~~~~42.667

printf "%12.0f\n", 6 * 7 + 2/3;  #looks like ~~~~~~~~~~43
```
---

### * Filehandles

A filehandle is the name in a Perl program for an I/O connection between your Perl process and the outside world. 
That is, it’s the name of a connection, not necessarily the name of a file.
Filehandles are named like other Perl identifiers (with letters, digits, and underscores,
but they can’t start with a digit).

**But there are also six special filehandle names that Perl already uses for its own pur-
poses: STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR, DATA, ARGV, and ARGVOUT.* Although you may choose any
filehandle name you’d like, .red[you shouldn’t choose one of those six unless you intend to
use that one’s special properties.]**

```bash
$ ./your_program <dino >wilma
```
That command tells the shell that the program’s input should be read from the file
*dino*, and the output should go to the file *wilma*.

---

### * Opening a Filehandle

```perl

open CONFIG, "dino";  # only open file dino
open CONFIG, "<dino"; # the same as above

# open dino for writing someting in this file.  
# we’re sending the output to a new file called fred. 
# If there’s already a file of that name, 
# we’re asking to wipe it out and replace it with this new one.
open BEDROCK, ">fred"; 

open LOG, ">>logfile"; # open dino for appending
```
---

### * Closing a Filehandle

```perl
close BEDROCK;
```
- Perl will automatically close a filehandle if you reopen it (that is, if you
reuse the filehandle name in a new open) or if you exit the program.

- In general, it’s best to close each
filehandle soon after you’re done with it, though the end of the program often arrives
soon enough.

---
### * Fatal Errors with die

The die function prints out the message you give it (to the standard error stream, where
such messages should go) and makes sure that your program exits with a nonzero exit
status.

```perl

if ( ! open LOG, ">>logfile") {
die "Cannot create logfile: $!";
}

```
If the open fails, die will terminate the program and tell you that it cannot create the
logfile. 

.red[\*]Traditionally, it is 0 for success and a nonzero value for failure.

.red[\*]In general, when the **system** refuses to do something we’ve requested (like
opening a file), <code>$!</code> will give you a reason (perhaps “permission denied” or “file not
found,” in this case). 

---

### I/O Example

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl -w 

$thepath="/home/yulj/project"; 
$gen_file="$thepath/mouse.fastq";
 
open DATA, $gen_file or die "cannot open file";

while (<DATA>) { 
   $out_file="$thepath/mouse.txt";
   open LOG,">$out_file" or die "Couldn't open $out_file: $!";
   print LOG $_; 
   close LOG; 
} 

close DATA;
```

# Hashes

## What Is a Hash?
]

.right-column[
A hash is a **data structure**, not unlike an array in that it can hold any number of values
and retrieve them at will. But instead of indexing the values by number, as we did with
arrays, we’ll look up the values by *name*. That is, the indices (here, we’ll call them
**keys**) aren’t numbers, but instead they are arbitrary unique strings.

.right-column[
*Word, count of number of times that word appears*

The idea here is that you want to know how often each word appears in a given
document. We can use hashes to count the nucleotide percentage for DNA/RNA sequence.
]

---

### * Hash Element Access

```perl
# This is similar to what we used for array access, 
# but here we use curly braces instead of square brackets around the subscript (key).
$hash{$some_key}

$family_name{"fred"} = "flintstone";
$family_name{"barney"} = "rubble";

foreach $person (qw< barney fred >) {
print "I've heard of $person $family_name{$person}.\n";
}

#The name of the hash is like any other Perl identifier (letters, digits, and underscores,
but can’t start with a digit). 

$family_name{"wilma"} = "flintstone"; # adds a new key (and value)
$family_name{"betty"} .= $family_name{"barney"}; # creates the element if needed

```
---

### * The Hash As a Whole

To refer to the entire hash, use the percent sign (%) as a prefix. So, the hash we’ve been
using for the last few pages is actually called %family_name.


For convenience, a hash may be converted into a list, and back again. Assigning to a
hash is a list-context assignment, where the list is made of key-value pairs:
```perl
%some_hash = ("foo", 35, "bar", 12.4, 2.5, "hello",
              "wilma", 1.72e30, "betty", "bye\n");
```

The value of the hash (in a list context) is a simple list of key-value pairs:
```perl
@any_array = %some_hash;

print "@any_array\n";
# might give something like this:
# betty bye (and a newline) wilma 1.72e+30 foo 35 2.5 hello bar 12.4
```
The order is **jumbled** because .red[Perl keeps the key-value pairs in an order that’s conven-
ient for Perl so that it can look up any item quickly.]

---

### * Hash Assignment

```perl
%new_hash = %old_hash; # assignment
%inverse_hash = reverse %any_hash; # inverse hash

```
This takes %any_hash and unwinds it into a list of key-value pairs, making a list like
(key, value, key, value, key, value, ...). Then reverse turns that list end-for-end, making
a list like **(value, key, value, key, value, key, ...)**. 

**This will work properly only if the values in the original hash were .red[unique]—otherwise,
we’d have duplicate keys in the new hash, and keys are always unique. Here’s the rule
that Perl uses: the last one in wins. **

---
### * The Big Arrow

When assigning a list to a hash, sometimes it’s not obvious which elements are keys
and which are values.
```perl
# not clearly
%some_hash = ("foo", 35, "bar", 12.4, 2.5, "hello",
              "wilma", 1.72e30, "betty", "bye\n"); 
```


Here, it’s easy (or perhaps at least easier) to see whose name pairs with which value,
even if we end up putting many pairs on one line. 
```perl
my %last_name = ( # a hash may be a lexical variable
  "fred"    =>  "flintstone",
  "dino"    =>  undef,
  "barney"  =>  "rubble",
  "betty"   =>  "rubble",
);
```

---

### * Hash Functions

- The keys and values Functions

```perl
# @k will contain "a", "b", and "c", and @v will contain 1, 2, and 3
my %hash = ("a" => 1, "b" => 2, "c" => 3);
my @k = keys %hash;
my @v = values %hash;
my $count = keys %hash; # gets 3, meaning three key-value pairs
```

- The each Function

In practice, the only way to use each is in a while loop, something like this:
```perl
while ( ($key, $value) = each %hash ) {
  print "$key => $value\n";
}
```
- The exists Function and  delete Function

```perl
if (exists $books{"dino"}) {
  print "Hey, there's a library card for dino!\n";
} # That is to say, exists $books{"dino"} will return a true value if (and only if) dino is
# found in the list of keys from keys %books.

delete $book{"dino"}; # after a delete, the key can’t exist in the hash, 
#but after storing undef, the key must exist
```

---

### Hash example

Here is a example of double hash.
```perl
#! /bin/perl -w
$hash{'orange'}{'red'} = 'red orange';
$hash{'orange'}{'green'} = 'green orange';
$hash{'apple'}{'red'} = 'red apple';
$hash{'apple'}{'green'} = 'green apple';
# $kkk=\%hash; 
foreach $fruit (keys %hash)
{
    foreach $color (keys %{$hash{$fruit}})
    {
        print $hash{$fruit}{$color},"\n";
        # print $kkk->{$fruit}->{$color} , "\n";
    }
}
```

# In the World of Regular Expressions

(Larning Perl: Chapter 7)

---

### * What Are Regular Expressions?

A regular expression, often called a **pattern** in Perl, is a template that either matches or
doesn’t match a given string.

- Don’t confuse regular expressions with shell filename-matching patterns, called
globs. A typical glob is what you use when you type *.pm to the Unix shell to match all
filenames that end in .pm. The previous example uses a glob of chapter*.txt. (You may
have noticed that you had to quote the pattern to prevent the shell from treating it like
a glob.)

### * Using Simple Patterns

To match a pattern (regular expression) against the contents of <code>$_</code>, simply put the pat-
tern between a pair of forward slashes (**/**), like we do here:

```perl
$_ = "yabba dabba doo";
  if (/abba/) {
  print "It matched!\n";
}
```

The expression /abba/ looks for that four-letter string in $_; if it finds it, it returns a
true value. 

Because the pattern match is generally being used to return a true or false value, it is
almost always found in the conditional expression of **if** or **while**.

All of the usual backslash escapes that you can put into double-quoted strings are
available in patterns, so you could use the pattern /coke\tsprite/ to match the 11
characters of coke, a tab, and sprite.
