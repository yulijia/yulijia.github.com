 I have read the **Llama** book many times, 
 and in this year (2014) I began help friends to learn Perl language with this book. 
 
 I made this slide to conclude some tips and useful script we learned.red[\*]. 
 We use Perl in bioinformatics field, 
 so there are some simple bioinformatics program examples in this slide.

# Input and Output

(Larning Perl: Chapter 5)
---

### * Input from Standard Input

```perl
while (defined($_ = <STDIN>)) {
print "I saw $_";
}

```

we’re reading the input into a variable, checking that it’s **defined**, 
and if it is (meaning that we haven’t reached the end of the input) we’re running the body of the while loop. 

### * Output to Standard Output

```perl
print @array;  # print a list of items
print "@array";  # print a string (containing an interpolated array)
```
if @array holds <code>qw/ fred barney betty /</code>,
the first one prints <code>fredbarneybetty</code>, 
while the second prints <code>fred barney betty</code> separated by spaces.

---
Useful script

```perl
print <>; # source code for 'cat'
print sort <>; # source code for 'sort'
```
.red[\*] Perl makes it very easy for you to read input, 
from either the keyboard or a file, 
with the .red[Diamond Operator] <code><></code> . 
Each call to this operator will return one line from the current input source, 
which can be stored in a variable for later use. 

---

### * Formatted Output with printf

```perl
printf "%g %g %g\n", 5/2, 51/17, 51 ** 17;  #2.5 3 1.0683e+29

printf "in %d days!\n", 17.85;  #in 17 days!

printf "%6d\n", 42;  #output like ~~~~42 (the ~ symbol stands for a space)

printf "%10s\n", "wilma";  #looks like ~~~~~wilma

printf "%-15s\n", "flintstone";  #looks like flintstone~~~~~

printf "%12f\n", 6 * 7 + 2/3;  #looks like ~~~42.666667

printf "%12.3f\n", 6 * 7 + 2/3;  #looks like ~~~~~~42.667

printf "%12.0f\n", 6 * 7 + 2/3;  #looks like ~~~~~~~~~~43
```
---

### * Filehandles

A filehandle is the name in a Perl program for an I/O connection between your Perl process and the outside world. 
That is, it’s the name of a connection, not necessarily the name of a file.
Filehandles are named like other Perl identifiers (with letters, digits, and underscores,
but they can’t start with a digit).

**But there are also six special filehandle names that Perl already uses for its own pur-
poses: STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR, DATA, ARGV, and ARGVOUT.* Although you may choose any
filehandle name you’d like, .red[you shouldn’t choose one of those six unless you intend to
use that one’s special properties.]**

```bash
$ ./your_program <dino >wilma
```
That command tells the shell that the program’s input should be read from the file
*dino*, and the output should go to the file *wilma*.

---

### * Opening a Filehandle

```perl

open CONFIG, "dino";  # only open file dino
open CONFIG, "<dino"; # the same as above

# open dino for writing someting in this file.  
# we’re sending the output to a new file called fred. 
# If there’s already a file of that name, 
# we’re asking to wipe it out and replace it with this new one.
open BEDROCK, ">fred"; 

open LOG, ">>logfile"; # open dino for appending
```
---

### * Closing a Filehandle

```perl
close BEDROCK;
```
- Perl will automatically close a filehandle if you reopen it (that is, if you
reuse the filehandle name in a new open) or if you exit the program.

- In general, it’s best to close each
filehandle soon after you’re done with it, though the end of the program often arrives
soon enough.

---
### * Fatal Errors with die

The die function prints out the message you give it (to the standard error stream, where
such messages should go) and makes sure that your program exits with a nonzero exit
status.

```perl

if ( ! open LOG, ">>logfile") {
die "Cannot create logfile: $!";
}

```
If the open fails, die will terminate the program and tell you that it cannot create the
logfile. 

.red[\*]Traditionally, it is 0 for success and a nonzero value for failure.

.red[\*]In general, when the **system** refuses to do something we’ve requested (like
opening a file), <code>$!</code> will give you a reason (perhaps “permission denied” or “file not
found,” in this case). 

---

### I/O Example

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl -w 

$thepath="/home/yulj/project"; 
$gen_file="$thepath/mouse.fastq";
 
open DATA, $gen_file or die "cannot open file";

while (<DATA>) { 
   $out_file="$thepath/mouse.txt";
   open LOG,">$out_file" or die "Couldn't open $out_file: $!";
   print LOG $_; 
   close LOG; 
} 

close DATA;
```

# Hashes

(Larning Perl: Chapter 6)

---
layout: false

.left-column[
## What Is a Hash?
]

.right-column[
A hash is a **data structure**, not unlike an array in that it can hold any number of values
and retrieve them at will. But instead of indexing the values by number, as we did with
arrays, we’ll look up the values by *name*. That is, the indices (here, we’ll call them
**keys**) aren’t numbers, but instead they are arbitrary unique strings.

## Why Use a Hash?
]

.right-column[
*Word, count of number of times that word appears*

The idea here is that you want to know how often each word appears in a given
document. We can use hashes to count the nucleotide percentage for DNA/RNA sequence.
]

---

### * Hash Element Access

```perl
# This is similar to what we used for array access, 
# but here we use curly braces instead of square brackets around the subscript (key).
$hash{$some_key}

$family_name{"fred"} = "flintstone";
$family_name{"barney"} = "rubble";

foreach $person (qw< barney fred >) {
print "I've heard of $person $family_name{$person}.\n";
}

#The name of the hash is like any other Perl identifier (letters, digits, and underscores,
but can’t start with a digit). 

$family_name{"wilma"} = "flintstone"; # adds a new key (and value)
$family_name{"betty"} .= $family_name{"barney"}; # creates the element if needed

```
---

### * The Hash As a Whole

To refer to the entire hash, use the percent sign (%) as a prefix. So, the hash we’ve been
using for the last few pages is actually called %family_name.


For convenience, a hash may be converted into a list, and back again. Assigning to a
hash is a list-context assignment, where the list is made of key-value pairs:
```perl
%some_hash = ("foo", 35, "bar", 12.4, 2.5, "hello",
              "wilma", 1.72e30, "betty", "bye\n");
```

The value of the hash (in a list context) is a simple list of key-value pairs:
```perl
@any_array = %some_hash;

print "@any_array\n";
# might give something like this:
# betty bye (and a newline) wilma 1.72e+30 foo 35 2.5 hello bar 12.4
```
The order is **jumbled** because .red[Perl keeps the key-value pairs in an order that’s conven-
ient for Perl so that it can look up any item quickly.]

---

### * Hash Assignment

```perl
%new_hash = %old_hash; # assignment
%inverse_hash = reverse %any_hash; # inverse hash

```
This takes %any_hash and unwinds it into a list of key-value pairs, making a list like
(key, value, key, value, key, value, ...). Then reverse turns that list end-for-end, making
a list like **(value, key, value, key, value, key, ...)**. 

**This will work properly only if the values in the original hash were .red[unique]—otherwise,
we’d have duplicate keys in the new hash, and keys are always unique. Here’s the rule
that Perl uses: the last one in wins. **

---
### * The Big Arrow

When assigning a list to a hash, sometimes it’s not obvious which elements are keys
and which are values.
```perl
# not clearly
%some_hash = ("foo", 35, "bar", 12.4, 2.5, "hello",
              "wilma", 1.72e30, "betty", "bye\n"); 
```


Here, it’s easy (or perhaps at least easier) to see whose name pairs with which value,
even if we end up putting many pairs on one line. 
```perl
my %last_name = ( # a hash may be a lexical variable
  "fred"    =>  "flintstone",
  "dino"    =>  undef,
  "barney"  =>  "rubble",
  "betty"   =>  "rubble",
);
```

---

### * Hash Functions

- The keys and values Functions

```perl
# @k will contain "a", "b", and "c", and @v will contain 1, 2, and 3
my %hash = ("a" => 1, "b" => 2, "c" => 3);
my @k = keys %hash;
my @v = values %hash;
my $count = keys %hash; # gets 3, meaning three key-value pairs
```

- The each Function

In practice, the only way to use each is in a while loop, something like this:
```perl
while ( ($key, $value) = each %hash ) {
  print "$key => $value\n";
}
```
- The exists Function and  delete Function

```perl
if (exists $books{"dino"}) {
  print "Hey, there's a library card for dino!\n";
} # That is to say, exists $books{"dino"} will return a true value if (and only if) dino is
# found in the list of keys from keys %books.

delete $book{"dino"}; # after a delete, the key can’t exist in the hash, 
#but after storing undef, the key must exist
```

---

### Hash example

Here is a example of double hash.
```perl
#! /bin/perl -w
$hash{'orange'}{'red'} = 'red orange';
$hash{'orange'}{'green'} = 'green orange';
$hash{'apple'}{'red'} = 'red apple';
$hash{'apple'}{'green'} = 'green apple';
$kkk=\%hash;
foreach $fruit (keys %hash)
{
    foreach $color (keys %{$hash{$fruit}})
    {
        print $hash{$fruit}{$color},"\n";
        print $kkk->{$fruit}->{$color} , "\n";
    }
}
```
