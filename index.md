**Welcome** to the website of Lijia Yu. I majored in Computational Mathematics when I was a undergraduate student at [BUCT](http://www.buct.edu.cn) and now I'm a master candidate majoring in Bioinformatics at [BIG](http://www.big.ac.cn). This site is mainly about biology, mathematics, data analysis, daily life, etc. By the way, You may find many grammar mistakes/Chinglish in this site, please contact me.

**A poem, I think the way I want to go:**

Zen Road  
To follow the path,  
look to the master,  
follow the master,  
walk with the master,  
see through the master,  
become the master.  

**Wishlist:** Star Trek
